<b> Note for Ian:</b>

<p>There are two remote repositories for this project:  "origin" and "github"</p>

<h1>Personal Programming Notes:  GIT</h1>

<p>This is my "Personal Programming Notes" project to summarize usage and document best practices when using GIT.  If you're an experienced user of GIT you don't need this reference.</p>

<p>The base work is in "flat open document" (.fodt) format -- OpenDocument XML.  I started this quite some time ago before leaving it by the wayside.  I've returned to the document with a desire to codify my more-mature understanding of GIT.</p>

<p>I'm beginning by working with my original haphazard nine page notes.  I've made an initial reorganization of the "Quick Start" section and am beginning to work on the rest.</p>

<p>I don't use public/open repositories, but I'm pushing these "Personal Programming Notes" to a public/open repositories to provide real-world experience with the open repository and to possibly provide some beginner notes to anyone who may be interested.</p>

<p>I don't know how social this particular site is; comments and suggestions welcome from experienced users of GIT only.</p>
