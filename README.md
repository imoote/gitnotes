**Note for Ian:**

There are two remote repositories for this project:  "_origin_" (a remote repository on my outward-facing server) and "_github_" (remote repository on GITHub).

Note that **git.odm** needs to be loaded after every edit to update the document revision number.  This also requires that it be committed along with edited files as well.  So when git says that it's changed, it's really been changed so make sure you commit it!

# Personal Programming Notes: GIT

These notes on the use of Git are the latest addition to my personal "**_Personal Programming Notes_**" project.  My "**_Personal Programming Notes_**" series summarizes usage, and document best practices, for various languages, frameworks, and tools.  I move back and forth between languages, frameworks, platforms, and tools, but because my experience is broad my knowledge isn't always deep and I often need a quick refresher when I do.

The base work for this document is in "flat open document" (.fodt) format -- OpenDocument XML.  I started this quite some time ago before leaving it by the wayside.  I've returned to the document with a desire to codify my more-mature understanding of GIT.

I'm re-entering this project by starting with my original haphazard nine-page notes.  I've made an initial reorganization of the "Quick Start" section and am beginning to work on the rest.

I don't generally use public/open repositories, but I'm pushing these "**_Personal Programming Notes_**" to public/open repositories to both provide real-world experience with the open repository (and to possibly provide some quick-ref notes to anyone who may be interested).

I don't know how social _GitHub_ is; typographical and grammar corrections welcome; other comments and suggestions welcome from _experienced users of **GIT** only_.  I have little patience for ultracrepidarian comments or "advice".

My personal programming notes are generally neither useful as tutorials nor helpful to inexperienced users.  For an in-depth Git reference you should download "**_Pro Git, Second Edition_**" from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2, updated regularly and available in fifteen languages online, most of which also seem to be downloadable in at least one of PDF, EPUB, or MOBI formats.  It is also apparently available for forking from https://github.com/progit/progit2.git.  Don't leave home without it.
