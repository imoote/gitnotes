**Note for Ian:**

There are two remote repositories for this project:  "_origin_" and "_github_"

# Personal Programming Notes: GIT

This is my "**_Personal Programming Notes_**" project to summarize usage and document best practices when using GIT.  If you're an experienced user of GIT you don't need this reference.

The base work is in "flat open document" (.fodt) format -- OpenDocument XML.  I started this quite some time ago before leaving it by the wayside.  I've returned to the document with a desire to codify my more-mature understanding of GIT.

I'm beginning by working with my original haphazard nine page notes.  I've made an initial reorganization of the "Quick Start" section and am beginning to work on the rest.

I don't use public/open repositories, but I'm pushing these "**_Personal Programming Notes_**" to a public/open repositories to both provide real-world experience with the open repository and to possibly provide some beginner notes to anyone who may be interested.

I don't know how social this particular site is; typographical and grammar corrections welcome; other comments and suggestions welcome from _experienced users of **GIT** only_.
